# inst414-final-project-Taliyah-German

Project Overview
This is a song recommendation system that generates a playlist based on user activity/user input. I'm using a Last.Fm music database to analyze metadata, generating a playlist using my model, and comparing relevance scores to a user's preexisting playlist (maybe)

Setup Instructions
- set your requirements.txt file using pip freeze > requirements.txt
- must have a Spotify account

Running the Project
- in the main.py, input target seeds/criteria (optional)
- if you just run straight through, a random playlist will be generated
- pip intall requirements.txt


Code Package Structure
- 'data' holds all of my data files 
- 'analysis' holds all of the code files that build the playlists (how, which data is being used and matched against, etc.)
- 'etl' holds all of the code files that extract, transform, and load all necessary data
- 'vis' hold all code files that allow for a visual representation of my data and findings
- main.py is where all packages will be run
